		  and we shall make it relatively easy by giving him a typewriter with a restricted keyboard, one with just the 26 (capital) letters,
		  and a space bar. How long will he take to write this one little sentence?
		  <blockquote>
			<p><i>Hamlet</i>: Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?<br><br>
						<i>Polonius</i>: By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.<br><br>

		The scenario is staged to produce a string of gibberish letters, assuming that the selection of each letter in a sequence of 28
		characters will be random. The number of possible combinations in this random sequence is 27<sup>28</sup>, or about 10<sup>40</sup>,
		so the probability that the monkey will produce a given sequence is extremely low.
		A computer program could be written to carry out the actions of Dawkins's hypothetical monkey, continuously generating combinations
		of 26 letters and spaces at high speed. Even at the rate of millions of combinations per second, it is unlikely, even given the entire
		lifetime of the universe to run, that the program would ever produce the phrase "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL".<br>
		Dawkins intends this example to illustrate a common misunderstanding of evolutionary change, i.e. that DNA sequences or organic
		compounds such as proteins are the result of atoms randomly combining to form more complex structures. In these types of computations,
		any sequence of amino acids in a protein will be extraordinarily improbable (this is known as Hoyle's fallacy).
		Rather, evolution proceeds by hill climbing, as in adaptive landscapes. Dawkins then goes on to show that a process of cumulative
		selection can take far fewer steps to reach any given target.

		<p class="lead" align="justify">The program aims to demonstrate that the preservation of small changes in an evolving string of characters (or genes) can produce
		meaningful combinations in a relatively short time as long as there is some mechanism to select cumulative changes, whether it is
		a person identifying which traits are desirable (in the case of artificial selection) or a criterion of survival ("fitness") imposed
		by the environment (in the case of natural selection). Reproducing systems tend to preserve traits across generations, because the
		offspring inherit a copy of the parent's traits. It is the differences between offspring, the variations in copying, which become
		the basis for selection, allowing phrases closer to the target to survive, and the remaining variants to "die."<br><br>

		 Although Dawkins did not provide the source code for his program, a "Weasel" style algorithm could run as follows.
		 <blockquote>
		<ol style="font-size:20px"><li> Start with a random string of 28 characters.</li><br>
		<li>Make 100 copies of this string, with a 5% chance per character of that character being replaced with a random character.</li><br>
		<li>Compare each new string with the target "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL", and give each a score
		(the number of letters in the string that are correct and in the correct position).</li><br>
		<li>If any of the new strings has a perfect score (28), halt. Otherwise, take the highest scoring string, and go to step 2.</li>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="lead" align="justify">For these purposes, a "character" is any uppercase letter, or a space.
		The number of copies per generation, and the chance of mutation per letter are not specified in Dawkins's book;
		100 copies and a 5% mutation rate are examples. Correct letters are not "locked". Each correct letter may become
		incorrect in subsequent generations. The terms of the program and the existence of the target phrase do however mean that
		such 'negative mutations' will quickly be 'corrected'.</p>
